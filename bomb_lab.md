# Bomb lab solutions for each phase

I wrote the solutions for the bomb lab (The famous lab in CMU-CSAPP) briefly. Maybe you can get some hints by looking here. 

**The codes are randomly generated, so the specific inputs or functions can differ from this repo. You should check your code by yourself. **

Tip) If you use the gdb, set the breakpoint in <explode_bomb> to stop explosion.

## Phase 1
You see the function that compares 2 strings.
Use the gdb to find the string in the memory and use it as the input.

## Phase 2
You see the function that reads six numbers.
Also after getting the input, the following code checks the relations about the submitted numbers; in my case, it checks the first 2 numbers are 0 and 1, and the following numbers are generated by the fibonacci sequence (i.e. a[i] = a[i-1] + a[i-2]).

## Phase 3
(TBD)

## Phase 4
This phase is about recursive functions. 
For example, my code does:

Maybe the answer will be similar to this.

## Phase 5
(TBD)

## Phase 6
This implements a ??? in assembly. 

## Secret Phase
Linked list? Tree?
